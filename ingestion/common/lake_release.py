"""Keep the lake in a GitHub Release, so a fresh machine or a CI run can restore it.

The pipeline always works on a local lake. ``push`` packs it into release assets and
``pull`` unpacks them:

- ``bronze.tar``: bronze tables and the manifest (all a daily run needs, ~30 MB).
- ``pdfs-YYYY-MM.tar``: the original DA PDFs of one report month.

Tars are deterministic (sorted, fixed metadata), so an unchanged month has the same
sha256 as the asset GitHub already holds and is not uploaded again. A month whose PDFs
are only partly on this machine (a CI run that downloaded today's report) is completed
from its asset first. Every PDF is checked against its manifest hash before upload, so
a push can never replace an archive with a smaller or corrupted one.
